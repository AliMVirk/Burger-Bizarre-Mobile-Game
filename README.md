# Burger Bizarre Mobile Game

A retro, arcade-style puzzle game created using GameMaker Studio 2 and GML.

The game involves swiping the player in 4 different directions. There is no friction in-game, meaning only objects halt the player's movement.
Using these controls, the player must navigate their way to the next room.

This was a small project completed in 2019 with the intent to be published as a complete Android application.

### Sample Level Design
2 enemy objects exist that will kill the player on contact.
